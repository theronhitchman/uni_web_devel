### My Current Courses

- Math 1100 Mathematics in Decision Making

    Math in Decision Making is intended for a general college audience, and
    satisfies a Liberal Arts Core requirement for graduation. (That's a _thing_.)
    In my version of the course, we study some basic knot theory and Cantor's
    remarkable discovery about infinity before moving on to the required probability
    and statistics unit. I keep a [web page for the course][mdm] with lots of
    details.

<!--
- Math 2500 Linear Algebra (sections 01 and 02)

    Linear algebra is the study of the geometry and algebra of lines, planes, vectors
    and matrices. It is probably the most complete and useful bit of mathematics
    that a student learns in college. The major challenges in the course come from
    steadily rising levels of abstraction.

    In this course, we focus on making good mental models for linear algebraic
    situations, especially building intuition by connecting geometry and algebra.
    We shall also focus on the process of making examples and generalizing from them.

    The course web page for linear algebra is [here][linalg].

- Math 3600 Euclidean Geometry

    This course is an introduction (or a re-introduction) to axiomatic
    mathematical work. We shall study planar geometry, but the focus is on
    developing a mathematics professional's skill set. A lot more can be found
    on the [course web page][euclidean].

- Math 3630/5630 Differential Geometry

    We take up the classical material on curves and surfaces in space. The main
    idea is to use Calculus to measure how objects bend, so we end up looking at
    lots of second derivatives. This is an advanced topics course. The
    undergraduate and graduate versions of this course share [a web page][dg].



### Inquiry Based Learning

Mathematics is best learned by doing it yourself. With this in mind,
I use <em>Inquiry Based Learning</em> or a <em>modified Moore method</em>
in many of my courses. Most of the focus in class is on each individual student
(sometimes small groups) making sense of the mathematics on his or her own terms,
and sharing that progress with the class for critique.

I am an active member of the [Academy of Inquiry Based Learning][aibl], and currently
help organize the annual Legacy of RL Moore meeting.

### Standards Based Assessment

In order to facilitate better communication with my students about their progress,
I am experimenting in some courses with the ideas behind _Standards Based
Assessment and Reporting_. The big idea is to focus on the key learning
goals for the course and orient our work directly at them. This sounds
simple (and it is), but it has some major consequences for how things are done.
At this point, I am only working on this in one course (Euclidean Geometry).

### Mathematical Technology

The ready availability of computers for doing mathematical work enables mathematicians
(at all stages of development) to work in new ways. I am a big fan of the free and open
software movement, and my favorite mathematical software tools are

  - The [Sage Mathematical Software System][sage],
  - [Geogebra][geogebra], and
  - [Python][python].

### Past Courses

I have taught a wide variety of courses. I think this is the complete list.

### An Award

In October 2013, I was honored with the Teaching Award by the Iowa
Section of the Mathematical Association of America.
