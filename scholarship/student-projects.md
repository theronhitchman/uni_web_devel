title: Student Research Projects

If you are interested in doing a reading or research project, please contact me.
I can help you find the right person at UNI to mentor you. I have mentored several
students through projects, and have ideas for several more. To serve as a guide,
here is a list  of some topics I have mentored in the past.

Unless otherwise specified, these projects occurred at UNI.

#### Undergraduate Reading Projects

- the (2,3,7)-tiling of the hyperbolic disk,
- geometric ordinary differential equations,
- Clifford-Klein space form problem (Williams College),
- Fuchsian groups (Rice U.),
- representations of Lie algebras in physics (Rice U.)

#### Undergraduate Research Projects

- fundamental domains for Hilbert modular groups (an Honors Thesis), <em>Alyssa Soenksen 2007-2008</em>
- m-ary partitions (two projects),
  - symmetry of structure polynomials for m-ary partition functions, <em>Mackenzie Roepke, 2008-2010</em>
  - divisibility of m-nomial coefficients, <em>Duncan Wright, Summer 2011-Spring 2012</em>
- ambigrams (an Honors Thesis, second adviser), <em>Callie Kronlage, 2008-2009</em>
- large metric spaces with non-positive curvature (three separate projects on this topic)
  - The isometry group of a Continuum Product, <em>Corey Gevaert, Summer 2009</em>
