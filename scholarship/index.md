title: Scholarship
---

I am interested most in the interplay of geometry, dynamical systems and Lie
theory. In particular, my thesis was on rigidity phenomena for actions of lattice
subgroups of semisimple Lie groups on compact smooth manifolds.
(This is part of the <em>Zimmer Program</em>.) Lately, I have done some work with
students in combinatorics on m-ary partition functions. As a post-doctoral
instructor I also worked on a mathematical biology project.
