<h2>For Current Students</h2>

This term, my formal teaching assignment is:

[Math in Decision Making](https://euphemismsabound.blogspot.com/){: .btn .btn--large .btn--success}
[Euclidean Geometry](https://medialtriangle.blogspot.com/){: .btn .btn--large .btn--primary}

Students in those courses should follow the links in those buttons above.

<h3>About Office Hours:</h3>

Office Hours for Fall 2020 will be held virtually. An appointment will be required,
because it is terrible to sit still in front of an empty video call for even an
hour. I will communicate how this will work with my students and advisees during
the first week of classes.

<!--
Office Hours for Fall 2019 are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday from
3-4:30pm, and Friday 3-4pm.

<strong>Note:</strong> An appointment is NOT required. During the late
afternoons, if I am in my office and the door is open, I welcome your visit.

If the late afternoon won't work for you, please get in touch with me by email,
and we can work something out.
