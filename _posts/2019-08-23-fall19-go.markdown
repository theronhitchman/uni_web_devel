My office is a disaster! I have made such a mess over the summer that I am going
to have to spend significant time during the first week of classes making it
suitable for visitors.

This term I have three courses to teach:

 * Math 2500 Linear Algebra
 * Math 3425/5425 Differential Equations
 * Math 6282 Studies in Polynomials and Surfaces

I will also continue to mentor my MA graduate student, and I will start a new
project with a new undergraduate student. Those mentoring projects are what
will allow me to continue doing research in knot theory (a branch of topology).

I have a lot of service commitments to work on this term, as many initiatives
across the University and in my Department have
'get this done immediately'-style deadlines and will require my attention.

My other projects this term are:

  * Continuing to mentor the participants from the
  <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org">AIBL</a> workshop
  <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/workshopleaders/">this past summer in St Paul</a>,
  * Continuing duties as the new Senior Editor of
  <a href="http://jiblm.org">
  Journal of Inquiry Based Learning in Mathematics</a> for modules,
  * Serving as the Iowa Section Representative to the MAA Congress,
  * Chairing the UNI Mathematics Committee (overseeing curriculum matters),
  * First-year and transfer advising for math,
  * and work on various other committees (Undergraduate Research, Recruitment and Retention, Student Outcomes Assessment, Competitions, etc)
