excerpt: "The White Rabbit Says, I'm Late!"

I am late putting up this post. I guess that is just the way of things: web pages are hard to maintain in a timely fashion without a lot of effort.

This term I have three courses to teach:

 * Math 2500 Linear Algebra
 * Math 3410/5410 Dynamical systems
 * Math 3600/5600 Euclidean Geometry.

I have somewhere between two and four students I am mentoring in research,
depending on you you count.

All of that service stuff is continuing, too. And I think I'll be helping with
some more IBL workshops throughout the spring and into the summer.

And later this term, I plan on starting to referee high school soccer games! I am gonna have to get fit!
