title: What is this?
---

Good Question! (That was guaranteed. I asked it, so of course I think it was a good question.)

For now, this is an experimental place-holder. I had though to move my reflective practice
teaching blog here, but I can't bring myself to really do it. There are all sorts of
reasons, some of them are even good ones.

I put in some work to build this little thing, so I am not going to kill it. For
now, this will get a new title "Count Vertigo Says," and just sit here. I know that
is a dumb title, but whatever. This is a functioning blog in a site I built myself
using Jekyll and Bootstrap. I may or may not use it.

But I put links to my commercially hosted blogs in the navigation bar across the top
of this page, and in the drop-down menu for those viewing this on a mobile device.
