This promises to be a challenging semester. Hang on: stay safe and hope for the best.

I am assigned these courses this term:

  * Math 1100: Math in Decision Making, sections 01 and 02
  * Math 3600: Euclidean Geometry

Now, that first course, is an odd one, as it is going to be a _hybrid_
course. Mostly online, with some traditional in-class meetings. Things
are still unsettled to a large degree, so students should watch for a
note from me in the week before the semester starts with a link to a
short orientation video.
