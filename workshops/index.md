### Sage Mathematical Software

I have run workshops for students (about an hour) and for faculty (half-day) on
the [Sage Mathematical Software system]({{site.sageurl}}). The focus during these
meetings is getting the participants enough exposure to the basics so that make
independent progress for themselves afterwards. We discuss the different ways to
use Sage, basic functionality, and where one can find more help.

### Inquiry Based Learning

I have a lot of experience using IBL in my own classrooms, and I have mentored
several other faculty who are new to IBL teaching. In the summer of 2014, I was
a presenter at the [Innovations in Higher Education Workshop][ihew] at Cardiff University
in Wales. My friend [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com) and I ran a full day
of introductory workshop time split over two days.
