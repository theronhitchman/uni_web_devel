      <p>I keep a reflective practice teaching blog at
        <a href="{{site.blogurl}}">Circles and Tangents</a>.
        I use git in my regular workflow these days, and my teaching materials
        are among my <a href="{{site.githubpageurl}}">GitHub projects</a>.
        I can be found at <a href="{{site.plusurl}}">Google Plus</a>,
        where I mostly discuss teaching, mathematics, and technology (especially
        <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a>). And sometimes
        I pop up on <a href="{{site.twitterurl}}">Twitter</a>.
